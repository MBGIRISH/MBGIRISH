### Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer

I build **production-ready machine learning systems** with a focus on **reliability, decision intelligence, and real-world impact**.  
My work goes beyond model training to include **monitoring, causal analysis, and system-level thinking**.

---

## 🔍 Focus Areas
- End-to-end ML systems: data → modeling → evaluation → deployment → monitoring
- Post-deployment ML: **data drift, concept drift, performance decay, retraining triggers**
- **Causal inference & uplift modeling** for decision optimization
- Time-series forecasting and anomaly detection for business-critical use cases
